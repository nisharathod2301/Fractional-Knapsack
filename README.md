# Fractional-Knapsack
Given weights and values of N items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. Note: Unlike 0/1 knapsack, you are allowed to break the item.    


Example 1:


Input:
N = 3, W = 50
values[] = {60,100,120}
weight[] = {10,20,30}
Output:
240.00
Explanation:Total maximum value of item
we can have is 240.00 from the given
capacity of sack. 

Expected Time Complexity : O(NlogN)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:


1 <= N <= 105;
1 <= W <= 105
